# underfitters - InNeed
UN World Innovation Day Hack 2022 Submission for Tech For Good

## What is InNeed?
A one stop solution to all the  problems that are faced by refugees.
Our idea explores the collaboration of public , private as well as individual entities to solve this problem. 

## Why?
We have seen that there were over 10 million refugees by the end of 2010.
By the end of 2020 the numbers were over 20 million.This shows this that the number of refugees doubled in the span of one decade and the situation continues growing worse since then.

## Why InNeed?
We have partnered with a number of NGOs and government for the betterment of refugees and their lifestyles. We have made an app as well as a website where refugees can go and register themselves. InNeed is all they need to solve all the problems they face in their asylum country. We take care of all the problems ranging from the registration of the refugee to providing them basic necessities like food, shelter, healthcare, employment, education etc.

## Future Plans
We plan to extend our collaboration with other organisations working on the similar cause  so that we can provide better opportunities for the refugees.
Our vision is a future where all refugees are included in the communities that host them. Where refugees are able to participate in education and employment and become not only self-reliant but vital contributors to local economies.
